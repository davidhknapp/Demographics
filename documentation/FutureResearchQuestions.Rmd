~~~ Possible avenues for future research

What if we binned music enrollment as
  Big 3 (Band, Choir, Orchestra)
  "_____" ( Modern Band, Music appreciation, other small ensembles)
  "_____" ( Jazz Band, Theory, Conducting, etc..)
  

Are eco dis/minority populations less likely to persist in music education3rd and 4th years?

If we can get specifics on funding from Music will and Dallas Schools we can look at
before and after enrollment trends in those courses.
