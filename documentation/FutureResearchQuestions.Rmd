~~~ Possible avenues for future research

What if we binned music enrollment as
  Big 3 (Band, Choir, Orchestra)
  "_____" ( Modern Band, Music appreciation, other small ensembles)
  "_____" ( Jazz Band, Theory, Conducting, etc..)
  

Are eco dis/minority populations less likely to persist in music education3rd and 4th years?

If we can get specifics on funding from Music will and Dallas Schools we can look at
before and after enrollment trends in those courses. 

It sounds like there was a district push for Mariachi? When and what was this?
    I think this was an increase in funding?
    There was a conversation that took place, rather than a mandate, that shifted classes to Mariachi
      some stand alone schools started it then it bled out, about a third of the comprehensive middle and high             schools have mariachi now. 2020/21/(22 maybe) covid was an opportunity to shift priorities
          around this time is when they decided not to use music appreciation as a dumping ground,
            this marked the introduction of a modern band code
            
            the only schools in Dallas these days that have traditional Music Appreciation are typically Dual enrollment/special high schools, most all music appreciation now is modern band 
            Matt thinks that all music increased in enrollment but modern band and mariachi had the most significant impact
            
            
            Matt would like ....
              evidence of music education enrollment on attendance or on standaradized tests (STAR, EOC, ACT, SAT) and GPA
              impact music enrollment on military, college, or career enrollment or college graduation. 
              music enrollment impact on discipline?
              
The dif and dif idea might work really well if we compared the difference in persistence before and after implementation of modernband/mariachi course code
