~~~ Possible avenues for future research

Do modern and culturally responsive music ed classes serve a different population than traditional large ensembles?
  What if we binned music enrollment as
    Big 3 (Band, Choir, Orchestra)
     "_____" ( Modern Band, Mariachi, other small ensembles)
     "_____" ( Jazz Band(might be included in big 3), Theory, Conducting, etc..)
  
Persistance Questions
  Are eco dis/minority populations less likely to persist in music education3rd and 4th years?
  Does culturally responsive music education via avenues such as mariachi, modern band etc. improve retention for           different populations?
  Did Matt's shift of music appreciation impact the rates of persistance in music education?
  
After Matt's music appreciation shift, did these students take the one course they need in music and leave or did they stick around?

How did Matts music appreciation policy impact music education enrollment as a whole in the district? Were certain ensemble types effected more than others?

If we can get specifics on funding from Music will and Dallas Schools we can look at
before and after enrollment trends in those courses.
  This would likely be some kind of two sample ANCOVA, propensity score matching or synthetic control can create a        theoretical control group


Matt would like evidence of music education impacting administrator valued characteristics such as test performance.
Suggesting causality of music education on academic performance is difficult, however
  1) using a front door control approach with attendance as a mediator we may be able to suggest a causal relationship
      note) (there's something called a mediation analysis which I think is the same or simila as the front door                     control approach i mentioned)
  2) with data on music program funding for each schools we may be able to create an instrumental variable (IV) design
  3) if nothing else we could examine the effect off attendance on academic performance and/or music education on attendance as separate regressions.
  4) Is it possible that students responded well to Matt's cancellation of music app and it effected attendance?
  5) Matt mentioned examining military readiness? We could look into this although I'm not sure there is much there,        although that being said a significant amount of my band and choir kids were also part of ROTC in the high            school I taught at.
  
  
Using matching methods we could create a theoretical control group and compare populations attendance with music enrollment as the treatment variable
  ?) What is the effect of music ed enrollment on attendance?
