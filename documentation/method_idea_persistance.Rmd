I want to examine the effects of student characteristics such as race gender IEP ELL and Economic Status on students probability to persist in music ed. My idea is to do a logit regression with enrollment as the outcome and model the student characteristics as a vector in beta 1. I would do this model four times, once for students who dropped out after 1 year, once for students dropping after 2 years, again for 3, and finally for those who persist for all 4 years.. Then I could take the coefficients yielded for each of the student demographics and plot them as odds ratios on the y axis and years of persistence on the x axis. this would give me 8 data points in each year, (5 for race, 1 for gender, 1 for each IEP, ELL , and economic status). I could then fit a trend line or regression to this collective scatter plot. 

Is this idea valid? Is there a name for it? Or are the errors in my logic and method

#Response to concerns chat gpt had
In response to you, 

in 1.1. I will separate students that dropped out after one year from students that dropped out after two and three and four so their will be no overlap. This should also clear up the within-student correlation you brought up in 1.2, furthermore I could fit a quadratic as oppose to a linear line which would solve 1.3. 

What do you think of my method now?
I like your idea of survival analysis, event history analysis, repeated measure logistic regressions, and disaggregated trend analysis. Could you compare my idea and each of these as well?

Your revised approach is now **stronger**, but it still has some **selection bias concerns** since you‚Äôre stratifying by the outcome (years of persistence). However, if your goal is to **describe trends rather than make causal inferences**, it is a **valid descriptive method**.

## **Comparison: Your Approach vs. Other Methods**

| **Method** | **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** | **Best Use Case** |
|------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Your Approach (Separate Logistic Models by Persistence Category + Trend Plotting)** | Simple, allows for visualization of changing demographic effects over time, flexible (can fit non-linear trends) | Stratifies based on the outcome (selection bias), assumes groupings are meaningful | If the goal is **descriptive** trend analysis rather than causal inference |
| **Survival Analysis (Cox Proportional Hazards)** | Accounts for time until dropout, handles censoring (students still enrolled), avoids selection bias | More complex interpretation, requires strong proportional hazards assumption | If you want to study **how long students persist in music education** |
| **Event History Analysis (Discrete-Time Survival Model)** | Similar to Cox model but allows for time-dependent covariates, useful if enrollment decisions change annually | Requires dataset restructuring to long format | If you want to analyze **yearly enrollment decisions as a function of demographics** |
| **Repeated Measures Logistic Regression (Mixed Effects Logit)** | Models within-student changes over time, accounts for correlation within students | Requires tracking students over time, harder to interpret than simple logistic regression | If you want to see how **demographics impact continued enrollment at each transition year (1‚Üí2, 2‚Üí3, etc.)** |
| **Disaggregated Trend Analysis (Pooled Logistic with Year Interactions)** | Uses all students in one model, compares demographic trends across years, easy visualization | Still assumes a common trend per year, no within-student tracking | If you want to see **demographic trends without separating students into subgroups** |

## **How Your Revised Approach Improves**
1. ‚úÖ **No Within-Student Correlation**  
   - Since you **separate students into mutually exclusive groups**, each student appears in only one model.
   - This **avoids correlation issues** from repeated observations of the same student.

2. ‚úÖ **Flexible Trend Estimation**  
   - Using a **quadratic or non-linear trend** instead of a simple linear fit will **better capture changes in demographic effects** across persistence levels.

3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Selection Bias Still Exists**  
   - You're analyzing **only students who persisted exactly X years**, meaning the underlying reasons for persistence are **already different across groups**.
   - Example: If **low-income students are more likely to drop out early**, then the remaining students in years 3‚Äì4 are already a **self-selected subset** of more advantaged students.

## **How Your Approach Compares to the Other Methods**
### **1. Your Approach vs. Survival Analysis**
‚úÖ **Your Approach** is better if you want a **clear, descriptive trend of demographic effects over persistence years**.  
‚úÖ **Survival Analysis** is better if you want to study **how long students persist before dropping out** and **account for students still enrolled** (censored data).  

**üöÄ Recommended If:**  
- You want a **time-to-dropout analysis with hazard ratios** ‚Üí **Survival Analysis**  
- You want a **simple trend visualization of demographic effects** ‚Üí **Your Approach**

---

### **2. Your Approach vs. Event History Analysis**
‚úÖ **Your Approach** is better if you want a **fixed categorization of students (1-year, 2-year, etc.)**.  
‚úÖ **Event History Analysis** is better if you want to **analyze yearly enrollment decisions** instead of a single persistence decision.  

**üöÄ Recommended If:**  
- You want **yearly probability of staying in music (e.g., how ELL status affects dropping out each year)** ‚Üí **Event History Analysis**  
- You want **one-time persistence comparisons per demographic group** ‚Üí **Your Approach**

---

### **3. Your Approach vs. Repeated Measures Logistic Regression**
‚úÖ **Your Approach** is better if you prefer **separate models per group** and simpler interpretation.  
‚úÖ **Repeated Measures Logit** is better if you want to **track students each year** and model **how demographics affect the probability of continuing at each transition (1‚Üí2, 2‚Üí3, etc.)**.  

**üöÄ Recommended If:**  
- You want to **control for individual differences and track within-student changes over time** ‚Üí **Repeated Measures Logistic Regression**  
- You want a **static summary of how demographics differ across persistence levels** ‚Üí **Your Approach**

---

### **4. Your Approach vs. Disaggregated Trend Analysis**
‚úÖ **Your Approach** is better if you want to **fully separate students into discrete persistence categories**.  
‚úÖ **Disaggregated Trend Analysis** is better if you want **one pooled model** that allows demographic effects to vary across years.  

Example **Disaggregated Trend Model:**
```r
glm(enrolled ~ gender + race + ELL + IEP + Econ_Status + year + gender:year + race:year, 
    data = all_students_data, family = binomial)
```
This method **keeps all students in the same model** but **lets demographic effects vary by year**.

**üöÄ Recommended If:**  
- You want to compare **demographic effects across years in one model** ‚Üí **Disaggregated Trend Analysis**  
- You want **separate models per persistence level** ‚Üí **Your Approach**

## **Final Verdict**
| **Approach** | **Best If You Want To...** | **Trade-Offs** |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Your Approach** (Separate Models for 1-year, 2-year, 3-year persistence) | Show how demographic effects differ at different persistence levels | ‚úÖ Easy to visualize trends, ‚ö†Ô∏è Selection bias |
| **Survival Analysis** | Analyze **how long students persist** before dropping out | ‚úÖ Accounts for censored data, ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires proportional hazards assumption |
| **Event History Analysis** | Model **yearly dropout probability** instead of fixed categories | ‚úÖ Tracks yearly decisions, ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires more data manipulation |
| **Repeated Measures Logit** | Track **within-student changes in enrollment over time** | ‚úÖ Controls for individual differences, ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex model |
| **Disaggregated Trend Analysis** | Model **all students in one model** with demographic effects changing over years | ‚úÖ More efficient, ‚ö†Ô∏è Harder to visualize |

‚úÖ **If you want a clean, visual summary of demographic effects over time**, your approach is **valid and interpretable**.  
‚úÖ **If you want a more rigorous statistical model that accounts for individual tracking, try survival analysis or repeated measures logit**.

## **My Final Recommendation**
1. **Use Your Approach** (Separate Logistic Models) for **visualizing general trends**.
2. **Complement it with a Survival Analysis** to **confirm whether demographics affect persistence duration**.
3. **Consider Event History Analysis** if you want to analyze **enrollment decisions yearly instead of fixed persistence categories**.
